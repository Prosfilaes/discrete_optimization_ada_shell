This is basic Ada code to solve problems in the Coursera Discrete Optimization
class. There's no algorithm code here, but simply a reusable structure that
includes a timer.

As an added bonus(?), there's half-complete Ada bindings to the GNU Linear
Programming Kit. It's a thin binding, mostly automatically generated, but some
macros are filled in (the one's I needed) and necessary types and pointer ->
array argument fixes are installed, again where I needed them.

The license for the bindings is under the original GNU GPL version 3. The rest
... don't post it with class algorithm code in it. If you want to fork it for
class and put it online, go ahead, but I'd appreciate notification. If you
actually want to use some of it for out of class purposes, I suspect it will
end up unrecognizable. Again, I'd appreciate notification, but go ahead and use
it; I don't require any sort of credit or notice in the code.
